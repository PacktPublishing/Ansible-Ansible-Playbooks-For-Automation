Ansible is a powerful automation tool used for configuring and managing systems. It simplifies infrastructure management through declarative, agentless, and idempotent playbooks, ensuring efficient and consistent operations across diverse environments. 

This course begins with an introduction to Ansible and its core versus community versions, followed by environment setup, ad-hoc commands, and Playbooks. We will delve into variables, conditionals, loops, tags, handlers, and error handling, gaining proficiency in efficient task execution. Privilege escalation, package installation, and logging are explored, along with task reusability techniques. The course delves into Ansible and systemd facts and works with multiple environments through inventory files. Advanced options such as remote_src, delegate_to, and run_once are thoroughly explained, providing cutting-edge insights. Hands-on practice makes it ideal for those seeking to optimize their infrastructure management skills using Ansible. 

Upon completion of the course, we will have gained mastery over the automation tool to efficiently manage infrastructure and streamline operations. We will understand core concepts, ad-hoc commands, and sophisticated Playbooks. With knowledge of variables, conditionals, loops, tags, handlers, and error handling, you can optimize task execution.
